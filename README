Basic systemd inhibit delay program.

Usage: systemd-inhibit-delay WHAT COMMAND [ARGS...]

    systemd-inhibit-delay sleep swaylock -f

Note that the command *must exit when done*, as only then will the requested
operation continue. If you put "swaylock" for example, your system will
unnecessarily wait 5 seconds before sleeping (in the default configuration).
